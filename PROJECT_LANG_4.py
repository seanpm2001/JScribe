# About
# I decided to make the fourth project language file for this project (JScribe) to be Python, as Python is a good application level language to use. It is going to be used alongside C in the application layer, and alongside Objective-J and Inform 7 in the scope of the program. C will be used for more complicated tasks, while Python will be used for simpler tasks.
